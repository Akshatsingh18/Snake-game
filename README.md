# Snake-game
Tried to remake the famous snake game 
To move the snake use ‘ up arrow ‘ for up , ' down arrow ‘ for down ,’ left arrow ‘ for left  and ‘ right arrow ‘ for right Press any direction key stated above to start the game at any time 

The aim of the game is to collect all the dots       ( food ) and avoid the obstacles ( collision with snake body, borders ) . The speed of the snake is regulated .As you collect the food the snake gets longer , so increasing your likelihood of crashing into yourself when you have collected enough food you progress onto the next level where your snake gets longer and the amount of food to collect to progress through the level gets larger .

You get scored according to length of the snake and there is no concept lives once you hit an obstacle that’s it , game over dialogue box will open and game will starts working by pressing    
‘ enter key ‘ .
